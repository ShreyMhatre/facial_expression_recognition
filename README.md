# Facial Expression Recognition - Emotion Classification using CNN

This repository contains my implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for facial expression recognition. The goal is to classify facial emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry) from grayscale face images using deep learning techniques.

## Learning Reference

This project was based on various deep learning resources including TensorFlow documentation and CNN-based emotion classification tutorials.  
I used these references to understand how to build and train CNNs from scratch for image classification tasks.

## Objective

Build a multi-class classification model using CNN to recognize human emotions from facial expressions in images.

---

## Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

---

## Data Preprocessing

- **Dataset**: FER2013 (or similar publicly available facial emotion dataset)
- **Steps Involved**:
  - Loading grayscale facial images and associated emotion labels
  - Normalizing image pixel values
  - One-hot encoding emotion labels
  - Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets
  - Reshaping image data into (48x48x1) format for CNN input

## CNN Architecture

- **Convolutional Layers**: Multiple Conv2D layers with ReLU activation
- **Pooling Layers**: MaxPooling2D for spatial dimensionality reduction
- **Batch Normalization**: Applied to stabilize and accelerate training
- **Dropout**: Added for regularization to prevent overfitting
- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers for classification
- **Output Layer**: Softmax activation for multi-class emotion prediction

### Training Strategy:

- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
- Callbacks: 
  - ReduceLROnPlateau for dynamic learning rate adjustment
  - EarlyStopping to prevent overfitting
- Evaluation Metric: Accuracy

## Evaluation Metric

- **Accuracy** â€” Multi-class classification accuracy on validation and test datasets

---

## Data Usage

Due to dataset licensing and size, the dataset is not included in this repository.  
You can download the FER2013 dataset from [Kaggle FER2013 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) and place it in a local `data/` folder for usage.
